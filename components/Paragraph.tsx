          10 minutes of mentoring per day: The optimal way to more happiness and

          Spotify model recommends 47-50 minutes per day for personal
          reflection, review and learning
          <br />
          <br />
          Regular time for reviews, reflections and learning are already planned
          in the agile organizational models as a constitutive element in the
          daily processes.
          <br />
          <br />
          So there is the so-called “Hack Day” in the “Spotify model”. 10% of
          the actual working time should be reserved for the "Hack Day" to
          promote team development, develop new ideas, promote knowledge
          transfer and strengthen team cohesion.
          <br />
          <br />
          With a weekly working time of 35-42 hours, that would be 3.5-4.2 hours
          per week, or the equivalent of around 47-50 minutes per day. Managers
          should take this time for their own reflection, reviews and learning.
          The aim is to remove daily "obstacles", knowledge transfer, continuous
          improvement of one's own way of working in a team, promotion of team
          cohesion and personal development.

          Another recommendation comes from happiness research. Here they
          examined the question: "How do you train managers for a higher level
          of happiness at work?". The following five "to dos" were derived
          (Achor, 2011):

          in the last 24 hours.

          Exercise 10 minutes a day;

          Meditate for 2 minutes and focus on your breath going in and out;

          Mental Research: Increase social intelligence with 10 minutes of
          dialogue per day for 3 months
          <br />
          <br />A comprehensive clinical study shows how to promote social
          intelligence. Two people participated in a daily 10-minute exercise in
          which they engaged in dialogue with each other. The task was to
          conduct a conversation in which the change of perspective (role
          exchange), active listening and reflection were practiced. This
          exercise was carried out over 3 months. As a result, a significant
          increase in empathy, social intelligence, self-reflection skills and
          an improvement in self-awareness could be determined. Result of the
          study: Understanding one's own feelings, intentions and beliefs as
          those of others is a crucial social skill both for our personal lives
          and for coping with the challenges of a globalized world.

          How can the recommendations for more happiness, more empathy, higher
          social intelligence be implemented through personal reflection,
          reviews and learning in a manager's everyday work?

          Mentoring is ideal for this, as it includes the dialogue between
          mentor and mentee and works on the topics presented here.

          The studies show that significant effects can be achieved with a daily
          10-minute use of these instruments over a period of at least 3 months.
